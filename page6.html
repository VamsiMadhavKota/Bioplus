<span style="color:#000000;font-family:Arial;font-size:24px;">• <strong>Title: Automatic Traffic Signal Detection &amp; V2V Communication using RCNN (Neural Network)<br></strong>The purpose of this was to collect real time traffic data and employ the collected datasets by integrating then into region based convolutional neural networks. Region-Based Convolutional Neural Networks were utilized to trace and detect the real-time traffic signals and associated information from different regions at different times during the day and in different conditions and then integrated that into the Portable Electronic System (Prototype) to automatically activate the electromagnetic braking system in vehicles and communicate these signals to the vehicles behind the test vehicle holding the prototype. Raspberry Pi and Zigbee operating systems were used to automate the above-mentioned idea. This project was performed under the guidance of Mr. V. Manoj Kumar, SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Chennai.<br><br>• <strong>Title: Robot Configuration (Cylindrical Robot)</strong><br>In this project, a system including an Arduino and electrical servo motors were programmed to work in an automated manner and the model was miniaturized. This project was performed under the guidance of Mr. J. Daniel Glad Stephen, SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Chennai.<br><br>• <strong>Title: Automation Fluid Plant using Programmable Logic Controller</strong><br>In this project, a Programmable Logic Controller was employed to automate a fuel and water treatment plant. It was noted that the use of programmable logic controls helped increase the efficiency of the plant and completely automate the entire system. This project was completed under the guidance of Mr. T.T Nagarajan, SRM University, Chennai.<br><br>• <strong>Title: Solar Pond Power Plant</strong><br>In this project, a novel proprietary technology was employed to generate solar energy from the surface of water bodies. This project was performed under the guidance of Mr. K. Chandra Mohan, SRM University, Chennai.</span></div>
